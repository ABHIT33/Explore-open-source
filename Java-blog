Overview and Criteria
There are several “Top Java Blogs” pages out there – but also a lot of noise.

Some of these blogs are abandoned with the last post a few years old, some have simply switched focused from Java to something else. Others are gone altogether.

This page is meant to an up to date view of the Java ecosystem.

In order for a blog/site to be listed, it needs to fit ALL of the following criteria:
