## Intro to CI/CD pipeline

Being developers ourselves, we understand your development needs. Notifying the team about a broken build to draw everyone’s attention to fixing the issue is one of the cornerstones of continuous integration. Some teams like all their notifications to come through email, while other teams prefer to receive their news in a Slack or Microsoft Teams channel. Either way, we’ve got you covered. Just flip the switch and we’ll send the events your way.

Continuous Integration and Delivery will send important build events, for example, when a build or stage starts, fails, or succeeds to the SAP Alert Notification Service API. You can create your own notification rules, subscribe to the events that are important to you and your team, and send notifications to a channel of your choice. Supported channels include Slack, Microsoft Teams, VictorOps, ServiceNow, email, and more.
